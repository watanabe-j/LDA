The set includes R code and data files used in "Quantitative discrimination of flightlessness in fossil Anatidae from skeletal proportions" by Junya Watanabe on The Auk: Ornithological Advances.

Contents:
README.md: This file.
descriptions: Detailed descriptions of functions included.
functions.R: Includes codes of functions.

Examples and data files will appear after publication of the article.

- Most functions were written on R 3.2.0.
- Codes may be slow, although I believe this would not cause practical problems.
- Functions Coef.B and Coef.pc.B depends on the package rrcov.
- A large part of the codes derives from those on Shigenobu Aoki's webpage (in Japanese): http://aoki2.si.gunma-u.ac.jp/R/ (accessed May 2015)
